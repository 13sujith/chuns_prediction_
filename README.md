# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Predicting churn helps identify customers likely to leave, enabling targeted retention efforts to improve business outcomes. 🎯

***

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset **Customer-Churn.csv** includes 7,043 customer records with 21 columns capturing:  
- 👤 Demographics (gender, senior citizen status)  
- 📞 Service information (internet, phone, streaming)  
- 📅 Contract and billing details  
- 💰 Charges and payments  
- 🔄 Churn status (target variable)  

***

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading  
Loaded the data using `pandas`.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍  
- Examined dataset shape, missing values, and column types.  
- Visualized feature distributions and relationships.

### 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing ⚙️  
- Converted and cleaned numeric columns (`TotalCharges`).  
- Filled missing values and removed duplicates.  
- Encoded categorical variables with one-hot encoding.  
- Dropped irrelevant columns like `customerID`.

### 4️⃣ Feature & Target Separation  
Separated features (`X`) and target churn variable (`y`).

### 5️⃣ Train-Test Split 🎲  
Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

### 6️⃣ Model Training 🏋️‍♂️  
Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** on the training set.

### 7️⃣ Model Evaluation 📈  
Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

### 8️⃣ Model Saving 💾  
Saved the trained model for reuse and deployment.

***

## ⚙️ How to Use  
1. Install required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `joblib`  
2. Run the notebook sequentially to perform EDA, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  
3. Use the saved model (`churnmodel.pkl`) to predict churn on new customer data after preprocessing.

***

## 🎯 Conclusion  
This project provides a complete pipeline from raw data to a deployed predictive model, supporting data-driven customer retention strategies that can reduce churn and improve business performance. 🚀📉
